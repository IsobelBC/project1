<p>All you need is a deck of cards and any container, a conventional cup will do but a pan or jug is usually favoured for aesthetics in my experience</p>
<p>Place the container of hoice in the middle of a surface and circle the ful deck of cards arounf it.(cards faced down ofcourse).</p>
<p>Make sure evryone is gather around the table and can reach the cards. Take it in turns to choose a card, each card has a different drinking task assigned.</p>
<p>The game ends when the final King is selected, whoever picks up this card must drink the 'dirty pint'</p>
