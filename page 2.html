    <H1>My Guide To Student Living</H1>
        <P>
          Your fist year at university is sold as the easiest, the most enjoyable and a time to find yourself.
          Well I am here to tell this is not always the case and in fact I think this is rarely the case,
          Your 1st year in  anew city surrounded by new people often studying a brand-new course can be very daunting 
          and it often takes longer than that 1st week to feel settled.
          I made many mistakes in first year which ire egret and urge others not to, so here are a list of things you
           should try and do during the 1st term of your 1st year<br></p>

        

        <div class="list2">
          <p>
             <h6 id="study" style="font-size: 18px; color:rgb(255, 0, 119); margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><u> 1.Join societies:</u></h6>it doesn’t matter what you doing but this will give you a great new space to meet new people
             and make new friends, friendships made during freshers week are often just that and it not often you will find your 
             best friend in your house. Being a member of a society, will cover from any future housing issues and dramas which
              do not disappear despite you all being technically adults.
                </p>
            </div>

      <div class="list2">
        <p>
          <h6 id="study" style="font-size: 18px; color:rgb(255, 0, 119);margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"><u>2.Keep on top of your studies:</u></h6> often you find yourself putting off classes for a hangover or watching Netflix instead
           of doing that assignment. Although 1st year does not count to your grade directly, 
           Keeping on top of things 1st year will help you more than you can imagine through 2nd and 3rd year which ultimately will impact your final grade.
          </p>

      <div class="list2">
        <p>
          <h6 id="study" style="font-size: 18px; color:rgb(255, 0, 119);margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px"><u> 3.Go home:</u></h6> a lot of people will tell you stick out at least 1 month of 2 months when you first move in to give yourself 
          a chance to settle in and get used to life at university. However, I disagree: I stuck it out for a month per this popular
           opinion and I regret it. Sometimes the best thing for your mental health when starting brand new life is to reground by going
            back to your familiar home. Having a clear mind is more important for settling in than duration.

      <div class="list2">
        <p>
          <h6 id="study" style="font-size: 18px; color:rgb(255, 0, 119);margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px"><u> 4.Read your tags:</u></h6>this may sound stupid but I have countless pairs of jeans that have been destroyed by the dryers 
          at uni, yes finding space for an airer is difficult and annoying but the alternative is having to wear either very small clothes
           or having to buy new ones which usually you can’t afford, so simply check your tags before simply whacking everything in the dryer likfe I did.

      <div class="one">
         <p>Another thing about university that you wont necessarily expect, is the amount of free time you have, I found myself bored 
          senseless quite often at university, yes you could always be studying but you can even over do that. By being part of a 
          club you will definitely hep to avoid this, but the spare time at some point may become overwhelming and can make you feel lonely.
          which can be really negative for your mental health
          <br>
        So here a list of things to do during you spare time at uni,</p>

      <h5 id = "skill" style="font-size:18px; color: rgb(255, 0, 119);margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px"><u>1.Learn a new skill:</u></h5>
      coding is great new skill to learn, its enjoyable and there’s loads of free online resources to get good at it. 
      By starting  anew skill in first year by the time you have finished your course you will have something new to add to your CV.
