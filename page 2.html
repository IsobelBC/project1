    <H1>MY GUIDE TO STUDENT LIVING</H1>
        <P>
          Your fist year at university is sold as the easiest, the most enjoyable and a time to find yourself.
          Well I am here to tell this is not always the case and in fact I think this is rarely the case,
          Your 1st year in  anew city surrounded by new people often studying a brand-new course can be very daunting 
          and it often takes longer than that 1st week to feel settled.
          I made many mistakes in first year which ire egret and urge others not to, so here are a list of things you
           should try and do during the 1st term of your 1st year<br></p>
        <p>
          1.	Join societies, it doesn’t matter what you doing but this will give you a great new space to meet new people
           and make new friends, friendships made during freshers week are often just that and it not often you will find your 
           best friend in your house. Being a member of a society, will cover from any future housing issues and dramas which
            do not disappear despite you all being technically adults.<br>
          2.	Keep on top of your studies, often you find yourself putting off classes for a hangover or watching Netflix instead
           of doing that assignment. Although 1st year does not count to your grad eat definitely does count so dint waste that time. 
           Keeping on top of things 1st year will help you more than you can imagine through 2nd and 3rd year.<br>
          3.	Go home: a lot of people will tell you stick out at least 1 month of 2 months when you first move in to give yourself 
          a chance to settle in and get used to life at university. However, I disagree I stuck it out for a month per this popular
           opinion and I regret it. Sometime the best thing for your mental health when starting brand new life id to reground by going
            back to your familiar home. Having a clear mind is more important for settling in that duration.<br>
          4.	Read your clothing tags: this may sound stupid but I have countless pairs of jeans that have been destroyed by the dryers 
          as unit, yes finding space for an airer is difficult and annoying but the alternative is having to wear other eery small cloths
           or having to buy new ones which usually you can’t afford.<br>
          Another this about university that you wont necessarily expect is the amount of free time you have, I found myself bored 
          senseless quote often at university, yes you could always be studying but you can even over do that. By being part of a 
          club you will definitely hep to avoid this but the spare time will at some point overwhelm and can make you feel lonely as its 
          rare that you’ll have friends to spend the time doing nothing with especially in your first year.<br><br>
          So here a list of things to do during you spare time at uni:<br>
          </p>

        <div class=" lists">
          <ol>
              <li>1.Learn a new skill:<br> coding is great new skill to learn, its enjoyable and there’s loads of free online resources to get good at it. 
                By starting  anew skill in first year by the time you have finished your course you will have something new to add to your CV.<br><br>
              <li>2.Baking: <br>his is a great way pass the time plus it can be a fun sizable even that does not involve drinking which sometimes we all need.<br><br>
              <li>3.Exercise:<br> Whether you join the gym or just make time in your day for an at home workout or run this is a great pass time plus its really good for your body. 
                Exercising releases endorphins and by working out during long periods of free time it can really<br>
